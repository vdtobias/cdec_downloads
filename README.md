# cdec_downloads
R code to make downloading data from CDEC easier

# What's in here?
There are two functions:
1. CDEC4govquery modifies the code from sharpshootR::CDECquery to download more data faster, using cdec4gov.water.ca.gov instead of the public CDEC download site. Note that this only works for computers on government IP addresses.
2. CDECcompyrs downloads all available data for a specified station, sensor, and range of years supplied by the user. 

This code comes with no warranty- this is something that I wrote for myself that a few other people have found useful. I welcome suggestions or contributions.
